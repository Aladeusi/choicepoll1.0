The voting system can dynamically add, edit and delete the position, course, students’ 
details and candidates.  Th
is implies that before the elections, the data base for all eligible
voters
has to be registered first, the number of positions and the details of the candidates 
running  for  each position including their pictures and manifestoes too
. However, 
the dat
abase can be edited
,
perhaps some voters graduate or there are new intakes into the 
department. Each student or voter is registered only once and with their ID number
.
Then  for  the  elections,  the  student  can  only  vote  with  his  or  her  ID  number  (MATRIC 
numb
er)  and  after  submitting  their  final  vote
,  the  voter 
cannot  change 
his/her  entry
.  the 
categorized  display  of  position  is  by  tabs
which  enables  the  voter  to  easily  navigate 
around the interface
.
For the post elections
process
, the total number of candidates
who voted and who 
did  not  vote 
will  be  displayed  on  request  by  the  electoral  chairman  or  any  higher 
authority  conducting  the  election,  corresponding  to  this,  the  total  number  of  voyes  each 
candidate  has  will  be  displayed  and  also  calculated  in  percentage 
in  respect  ot  his/her 
opponent, the winner for each position is then displayed on another tab, all these results 
can thus be printed to ensure proper documentation and clarity of results
